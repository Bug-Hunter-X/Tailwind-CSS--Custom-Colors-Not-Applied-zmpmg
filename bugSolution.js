```javascript
// Fixed tailwind.config.js
/** @type {import('tailwindcss').Config} */
module.exports = {
  content: [ "./index.html", "./src/**/*.{js,ts,jsx,tsx}"],
  theme: {
    extend: {
      colors: {
        'theme-color': '#f56565',
      },
    },
  },
  plugins: [],
}
```

Ensure that your `tailwind.config.js` is correctly configured and that you've correctly configured your build process to include the `content` array with your HTML file.  If using a build process (like Vite or Webpack), make sure you have a postcss plugin that integrates Tailwind into your build pipeline and that the output CSS is correctly linked to your HTML file.
